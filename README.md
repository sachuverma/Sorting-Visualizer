# SORTING VISUALIZER PROGRAM

## [View Project Here](https://sachu-sorting-visualization.netlify.app/)

A simple web-app created using React.js to visualize different sorting algorithms like, **Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort**.

You can generate any random array using _Generate a New Array_ button.
The array elements are represented as a bar with it's height representing it's value.  
Then the array can be sorted using the soring buttons.

_`Currently only merge sort is implement. Other algorithms will be implemented in future`_
